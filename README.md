# Stickerfy: Automation Test Project
## Automation Test Foundation course on Linkedin by Meaghan Lewis

This (*mini*) automation test project was conducted on the following website: https://stickerfy.herokuapp.com/. The testing was conducted using **Visual Studio Code** as the code editor, **Python** as the preferred programming language used to create automation scripts and run unit tests, and **Selenium Webdriver** as a tool for automating across the Chrome browser.

Automed test scripts (that can be found inside the folder 'testScripts') are used for the following:

* TEST 1: Adding a product to the cart with a desired quantity and verifying the total price (getTotalPrice.py)
* TEST 2: Removing an item from the cart by clicking **Remove 1** and verifying the quantity (removeItem.py)
* TEST 3: Removing all items from the cart by clicking **Remove all** and verifying the quantity (removeAll.py)

### **NOTE**: Run test.py by entering the following into the terminal: python -m unittest -v
